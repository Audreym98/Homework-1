    "# Homework 1: Basic linear regression\n",
    "## Due September 5th\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we've been working on developing the tools for linear regression.  In this homework, we'll use those tools to show that one of the original 'big data' problems can be solved quite credibly with ordinary least squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The big one\n",
    "If you've ever lived in an area prone to seismic activity, you know that people are always a little apprehensive about *the big one*, that giant earthquake (Magnitude greater than 7) that is going to break the pots and collapse the overpasses.  However, the big one rarely happens... until it does.  What happens more frequently is smaller earthquakes.  And even more frequently than that, even smaller earthquakes.  In fact, it's long been understood that earthquake frequency has an inverse relationship with magnitude.  Here, we're going to quantify that relationship for the west coast of the US.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data wrangling\n",
    "The first thing that we'll need to do is to aquire a dataset that can help us say something about earthquake frequency.  Fortunately, the United States Geologic Survey keeps such a database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First,navigate to https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/.  This is the USGS' central repository for earthquake data.  We'll be interested in data from the last ten years.  Enter the appropriate date.  Next, we're interested in data from the west coast of the lower 48.  Use the Custom Geographic Region button on the right side of the page, followed by the Draw Rectangle on the Map button.  Draw a rectangle around the west coast, from the Canadian to Mexican border.  Next, open the Output Options tab and select .csv (comma separated values, a plain text format).  Finally, under Limit Results, enter 19999 (the site will throw an error if you make this value bigger).  This series of commands will deliver the ~20k most recent earthquakes of all sizes to occur in this region of the world.  Download the file."
